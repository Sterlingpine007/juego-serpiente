# Simple Flask API
# Simple Snake Game

This is a tiny, single-file Snake game implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Files:
- `index.html` — page and canvas
- `static/styles.css` — styles
- `static/game.js` — game logic

How to run:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or `File → Open`).
2. Play: Arrow keys or WASD to move.
3. Press `Space` to restart after game over.

Notes:
- No build steps or servers required — static files only.
- If you want sound effects, mobile touch controls, or high-score persistence, tell me which and I'll add it.
